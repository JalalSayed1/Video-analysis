# Video-analysis
## About the project:
- Takes user's camera as an input.
- Outputs 2 videos where one of them is smaller than the original, and the other rotated 180 degrees.

## What did I learn from this:
- How to take video input and manipulate it in OpenCV.
- Using .resize() and .rotate() functions in OpenCV.
